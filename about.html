      <h3>A Brief History of African Cuisine</h3>
      <p>African cuisine is as varied as the continent itself, with each region offering unique dishes that reflect local traditions, ingredients, and cultures. From the spice-rich stews of North Africa to the flavorful jollof rice of West Africa, the continent's food culture has a rich history shaped by geography, history, and trade.</p>

      <p>African culinary traditions have spread across the globe, influencing the food cultures of the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Through colonization, trade routes, and migration, ingredients like cassava, plantains, yams, and spices like cumin, ginger, and saffron have found their way into global kitchens, leaving an indelible mark on world cuisines.</p>
